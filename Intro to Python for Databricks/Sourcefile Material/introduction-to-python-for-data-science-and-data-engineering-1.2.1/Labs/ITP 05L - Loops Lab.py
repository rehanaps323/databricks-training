# MAGIC ## Exercise: Bart Simpson in Detention
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://preview.redd.it/386z0p2eh5v21.jpg?auto=webp&s=383ef3536776dc3a34515e6cfd9979f363570a05" width="40%" height="20%">
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Bart Simpson got detention again... He needs to write **`I will not let my dog eat my homework`** 50 times. Of course, Bart is lazy, and needs your help to automate this in Python. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write a function called **`detention_helper()`** that takes in **`detention_message`** and **`num_lines`** representing the message Bart needs to write and the number of times he needs to write it respectively. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your function should print out **`detention_message`** **`num_lines`** times, but each line of **`detention_message`** should be numbered. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For example, if **`detention_message`** is `I will not let my dog eat my homework`, and **`num_lines`** is 50, the function should print
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `1. I will not let my dog eat my homework`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `2. I will not let my dog eat my homework`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `3. I will not let my dog eat my homework`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `.
# MAGIC .
# MAGIC .`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `50. I will not let my dog eat my homework`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we are parameterizing the **`detention_message`** and **`num_lines`** in case he gets detention again.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hint:** Recall the **`range()`** function, but make sure to start counting at 1, not 0. f-string formatting will also be helpful.

# COMMAND ----------

detention_message=["I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework", "I will not let my dog eat my homework"]
def detention_helper(detention_message, num_lines):
    for i in range(1, num_lines + 1):
        print(f"{i}. {detention_message}")
detention_helper("I will not let my dog eat my homework", 4)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC Call your function below with the correct inputs for Bart's current detention and make sure you can see "I will not let my dog eat my homework" printed out 50 times, with the lines numbered, as shown in the problem description.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Call your function below with the correct inputs for Bart's current detention and make sure you can see "I will do my python homework" printed out 25 times, with the lines numbered, as shown in the problem description.

# MAGIC ### Bonus Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Below is the code used to display a table of cities and their respective temperatures and humidities from a previous notebook.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Modify the code to use lists and loops instead of repetitive variables.

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO: Modify the code below to use lists and loops instead repetitive variables.

# city1 = "San Francisco" # Replace with a list named "cities"
# city2 = "Paris"
# city3 = "Mumbai"

# temperature1 = 58       # Replace with a list named "temperatures"
# temperature2 = 75
# temperature3 = 81

# humidity1 = .85         # Replace with a list named "humidities"
# humidity2 = .5
# humidity3 = .88 

# print(f"{'City':15} {'Temperature':15} {'Humidity':15}")
# print(f"{city1:15} {temperature1:11} {humidity1:12.2f}")
# print(f"{city2:15} {temperature2:11} {humidity2:12.2f}")
# print(f"{city3:15} {temperature3:11} {humidity3:12.2f}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Bonus Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write a function named `item_count` that accepts a list of values and returns a dictionary with a count of the number of times each unique value appeared in the list
# MAGIC - For example, `item_count(['a', 'b', 'a'])` should return the dictionary `{'a': 2, 'b': 1}`

# COMMAND ----------

def item_count(<FILL IN>):  
    <FILL IN>

# COMMAND ----------

assert item_count(['a', 'b', 'a']) == {'a': 2, 'b': 1}, "There should be 2 occurrences of the letter 'a' and one occurrence of the letter 'b'"
